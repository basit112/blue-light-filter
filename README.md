A blue light filter app for Android is designed to reduce the amount of blue light emitted from your phone's screen, which can be harmful to your eyes and disrupt your sleep. This app works by adjusting the color temperature of your screen to a warmer hue, which helps to reduce eye strain and promote better sleep.

The blue light filter app is easy to use and customizable, allowing you to adjust the intensity and color temperature of the filter to suit your needs. You can choose from different filter colors such as red, orange, and yellow, and adjust the filter intensity to your desired level.

The app also comes with a scheduling feature that allows you to set a specific time for the filter to turn on and off automatically. This means that you can have the filter turn on automatically in the evening when the sun sets and turn off in the morning when the sun rises.

The blue light filter app is perfect for those who spend a lot of time on their phones, especially in the evenings. It is also beneficial for people who suffer from sleep disorders or those who have trouble falling asleep. With this app, you can enjoy using your phone without worrying about the negative effects of blue light on your eyes and sleep patterns
