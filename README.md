# blue-light-filter
A blue light filter app for Android is designed to reduce the amount of blue light emitted from your phone's screen, which can be harmful to your eyes and disrupt your sleep. This app works by adjusting the color temperature of your screen to a warmer hue, which helps to reduce eye strain and promote better sleep.
